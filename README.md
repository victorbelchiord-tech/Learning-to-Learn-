**Learning to Learn 🧠**

**📝 Project Description**

Learning to Learn is a study management system developed to help students and technology enthusiasts organize their progress in different learning paths. The main objective is to allow the registration of courses, documentation of studied topics, and a clear visualization of what still needs to be learned.

The project functions as a personalized "Roadmap," where the user can centralize educational resources, useful links, and the completion status of each module.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

- HTML5: Semantic structuring of all page content.

- CSS3: Visual styling, using Flexbox and Grid concepts to ensure a responsive and modern layout.

- Git & GitHub: For code versioning and repository hosting.

**🚀 Project Completion Plans**

To elevate the application and make it a complete productivity tool, the following steps will be implemented:

- **Data Persistence Implementation with LocalStorage:**

Currently, data is lost when refreshing the page. The next step is to use the window.localStorage API to save the state of tasks and courses, ensuring that the user finds their saved information when returning to the browser.

- **Refactoring Filter Logic using Array Methods (filter and reduce):**

Replace generic loops with functional methods to create categories of "Studied", "Studying", and "Want to Study", allowing a segregated view of the user's progress.

- **Add Form Validation with Regex:**

Implement checks on input fields to prevent the registration of empty fields or invalid links, using regular expressions to ensure the integrity of the entered data.

- **User Experience (UX) Enhancement with Visual Feedback:**

Insert icon libraries (such as FontAwesome) and CSS transitions (transition and transform) so that, upon completing an item, the user receives a clear visual confirmation (such as a "strikethrough" effect or a smooth color change).

- **Advanced Responsiveness with Media Queries:**

Adjust CSS breakpoints to ensure the interface is 100% functional on mobile devices, adapting tables and forms for vertical smartphone screens.

- **Integration with a Motivational Quotes API:**

Use fetch to consume an external API and display a different motivational quote each time the user opens the dashboard, encouraging continued study.
